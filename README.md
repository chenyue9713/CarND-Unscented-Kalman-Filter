# Unscented Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Overview

In this project, I used C++ to implemented Unscented Kalman Filter to achieve prediction and measurement of position by data acquired from Lidar and Radar. Compared with Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter should have higher accuracy. 


## Environment Setup
Assume that you have already install all Dependencies tools: 
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF
